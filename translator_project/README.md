In this project I created a very basic translator.

To run this program, the user needs to run the command "python3 translator.py", and right after, the user will be asked to introduce one of the following arguments:

1- If the user chooses argument "a", the translator will translate the text inside of one txt file.

** previous to running this option, the user should modify the function "translate_from_file" and indicate the path where the file that should be translated.**

2 - If the user chooses argument "b", the translator will translate the input of the user in any language to English. 

FURTHER INFORMATION:
- The language settings of this translator can be modified, and the uesr can translate also from an specific language to another (i.e. from French to English, etc...) but the user will need to specify it in the corresponding function.

UPCOMING IMPROVEMENTS:
- The program should be able to accept only .txt files.
- The program should offer the user the possibility of try again when an error prompts.
- The program should aoffer the user the possibility to translate something else when the translation is done (aka re-run the program ) else exit the program.
- The program should ask the user where are the file that wants to translate located.
- The program should be more specific about the error handling.
