In this project I created a very basic translator.

To run this program, the user needs to run the command "python3 translator.py", and right after, the user will be asked to introduce one of the following arguments:

1- If the user chooses argument "a", the translator will translate the text inside of one txt file.

** previous to running this option, the user should modify the function "translate_from_file" and indicate the path where the file that should be translated.**

2 - If the user chooses argument "b", the translator will translate the input of the user in any language to English. 

FURTHER INFORMATION:
- The language settings of this translator can be modified, and the uesr can translate also from an specific language to another (i.e. from French to English, etc...) but the user will need to specify it in the corresponding function.
